CreatorPulse is a progress hub for content creators to track revenue goals, ad momentum, and platform health. Login Kit lets creators connect their TikTok account so their metrics appear in the dashboard.

Flow: User clicks "Connect TikTok" on creator-pulse-drab.vercel.app, authorizes on TikTok, and is redirected back. We exchange the code for an access token, fetch profile and stats, and display them in a Platform Overview card.

user.info.basic: Retrieves username and display name for the connected accounts section so users identify which TikTok account is linked.
user.info.profile: Fetches profile details to personalize the dashboard.
user.info.stats: Displays follower_count, following_count, likes_count, video_count in the platform overview so creators see audience metrics alongside revenue goals.

Data is shown only to the authenticated owner. We do not post, share, or use TikTok data beyond displaying the creator's own metrics.
